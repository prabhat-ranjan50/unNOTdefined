# unNOTdefined
The main difference between "undefined" and "not defined" is that "undefined" is a value that can be assigned to a variable, while "not defined" indicates that a variable does not exist.

Another difference is that "undefined" is usually caused by forgetting to assign a value to a variable, while "not defined" is usually caused by a typo or by trying to access a variable that is out of scope
