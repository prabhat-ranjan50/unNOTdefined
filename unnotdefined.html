    <h1>Undefined Vs Not defined in JS</h1>
    <h4>(This HTML page is linked with JS file.)</h4>

    <h3>In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them. If the
        variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be not defined, and if exists
        in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it would be undefined.</h3>
    <h2>1. undefined:</h2>
    <h3> It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything which gets a space in memory will contain
        undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.</h3>
    <h2>2. not defined</h2>
    <h3> In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable
        which is not inside the memory heap.</h3>
